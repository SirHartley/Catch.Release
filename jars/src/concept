fish

Pond fishing
- spawn ponds
    -> fish spawn decided by table pull on mote spawn
- extend ponds into lake with item (? - different spot types for drone fishing, standard spot type for hook fishing)

broken: spots don't render.

Pond fishing: Slower, relaxing with a longer minigame section, easier to target rare fish, easier to catch rare (or other) fish once upgraded. No requirements to do.
Bomb fishing: Faster, more exciting, short minigame section, easier to catch more fish but harder to target specific rarity. Doesn't get easier, just faster. Illegal in civilized volumes. Requires a fishing logi ship.
